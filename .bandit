# Bandit configuration for IRRExplorer

# Exclude test directories as assert statements are expected in tests
exclude_dirs = /tests,/api/tests,/backends/tests

# Skip specific checks
skips = B101,B301,B403,B110

# B101: assert_used - Normal in tests, excluded via exclude_dirs
# B301: pickle - Used safely for internal caching, not for untrusted data
# B403: import_pickle - Used safely for internal caching
# B110: try_except_pass - Acceptable for race condition handling
